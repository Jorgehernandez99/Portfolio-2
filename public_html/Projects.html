                            <p>This was the first Website I ever made. I used the programs Html, Css, and Netbeans to
                            make it. I also used source tree to commit and push my work onto Github and save it. It was sort of hard since I was new to coding and I had never created a website before

                            This is my Second Website I ever made. I used the same programs as the first which is Html, Css,
                            and Netbeans. I also continued to use Sourcetree to commit and push my work. In this Website I was introduced to a new program
                            which is bootstrap. Bootstrap includes a new free collection of tools for creating Websites and web applications.

                            Here is my third Website called Portfolio-3. I used the same basic programs that I use on all my projects which is Html, Css,
                            and Netbeans. I also continued to use Sourcetree to commit and push my work. This Website was made so I can work with the program 
                            JQuery and try to add new things that Jquery introduces such as an alert button, an accordion, adding/removing paragraphs, and much more.
                            I also added the enite page of Portfolio-3 onto Portfolio-2 because I couldn't mix them together.

                            This is my Snake Project. It was the first game I ever made and is my favorite out of all my
                            projects. Most of my Projects include basic stuff and a little bit of intermediate but in Snake I got to
                            include lots of intermediate stuff such as a snake design, a Start Screen, and more.Snake was made using JavaScript.

                            This is my Mario Project. It was the Second game I ever made and it was really hard. The reason it was really hard was because I kept on running into
                            errors. Most of my errors were mispelled words. Mario was made using Html, CSS, and MelonJS.
